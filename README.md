## Solution Description
Currently, Twilio does not have the ability to conduct sentiment analysis on the responses or inbound messages. As many brands is looking for ways to improve their customer engagement, sentiment analysis becomes increasing important especially when there is rising need to automate engagement, we need to take into account the customer's sentiment to provide amazing experiences. 

So by leveraging the power of Twilio's ability to be programmable, this project seeks to empower our customers to add-on keyword based sentiment detection to all inbound messages. This means across all messaging channels, such as SMS and WhatsApp. 

The "Word Bank" is maintained using Google Sheet which is widely accessiable to all customers. Everytime an inbound message comes in, the Twilio Function will check against the word bank for any occurance of keyword that represents a negative sentiment, and returns the result back to the Twilio Function and pass on into the Twilio Studio flow for further actions.
